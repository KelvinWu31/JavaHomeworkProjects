/* Name: Kelvin Wu
 * CISC 3130 TY2 
 * 02/18/2020
 * Assignment #1
 * 
 * Program Description: This Java Program was intended to read in a .txt file of artist names and sort them by alphabetical order
 * through the ArrayList and calling the collections' sort and reverse alphabetizing them. The ArrayList is then implemented into 
 * a Linked List by a insert method inside TopStreamingArtists backwards.
 * 
 * Errors:
 * - I had problems from the very beginning from reading the file to the actual output not showing up when I print it from the ArrayList
 * - Due to this Error, I had to manually separate the artist names from the file and could only read 75 artist names from the US Play List.
 * 
 * Output:
 * Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException
	at java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:937)
	at java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1478)
	at StreamingArtist.main(StreamingArtist.java:58)
